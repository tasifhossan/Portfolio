**To test the contact form submission, you need to run this website on a local server environment. Follow these steps:**



1\. **Install Laragon**: If you don't have it, download and install Laragon from the official website (\[https://laragon.org/](https://laragon.org/)). It's a free, easy-to-use development environment.



2\.  **Move the Website Files**: Place the entire website folder (the one containing your `*index.html*`, `*css*`, `*js*`, and `*php*` files) into the `*C:\\laragon\\www*` directory.



3\.  **Start the Server**: Open Laragon and click the "*Start All*" button. This will start the Apache web server and MySQL database.



4\. **Create a New Virtual Host:**

* Right-click the Laragon icon in the system tray.
* &nbsp;Navigate to *Tools > Quick app > Custom*.
* Laragon will ask for a name. Enter the name of your website folder (e.g., `my-website`). This will create a virtual host for you.
* Laragon will automatically open the website in your browser.



5\.  **Test the Contact Form:**

* Go to the contact page of your website.
* Fill out the form and click "Submit."
* The PHP script should process the submission. You can check the success or error messages to confirm it's working correctly.
