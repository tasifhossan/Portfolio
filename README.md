* **Working Contact Form:** A functional PHP-based contact form for direct communication.
* **Seamless User Experience:** Smooth transitions and intuitive navigation.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (with Media Queries for responsiveness)
* **JavaScript** (Vanilla JS for all dynamic features)

### Back-End
* **PHP** (for the contact form backend)

### Development & Hosting
* **Laragon** (for local development server)
* [Add any other tools or services you used, e.g., Git, GitHub, etc.]

## How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/[YourRepositoryName].git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd [YourRepositoryName]
    ```

3.  **Set up the local server:**
    This project requires a PHP server to run the contact form. Laragon is recommended.
    * Install Laragon (if you haven't already).
    * Place the project folder inside Laragon's `www` directory (e.g., `C:\laragon\www\[YourRepositoryName]`).
    * Start Laragon and it will create a local URL for you (e.g., `http://[YourRepositoryName].test`).
